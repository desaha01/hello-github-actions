# Generated Playwright Test Scripts

This directory contains automatically generated Playwright test scripts.

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have Playwright installed:
   ```
   npm install -g @playwright/test
   ```

2. Install browsers:
   ```
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. Run a specific test:
   ```
   npx playwright test script-name.ts
   ```

4. Run all tests:
   ```
   npx playwright test
   ```

## Generating Package Files

If you don't have a `package.json` file yet, create one with:

```
npm init -y
npm install -D @playwright/test
```

## Test Structure

Each test follows a similar pattern:
- Navigate to the target URL
- Perform a series of actions (clicks, form filling, etc.)
- Take screenshots at key points
- Include assertions to verify the expected state
